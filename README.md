# Neural Verification of Deep Convolution Neural Networks

## Features
- Allows formal verification of Deep CNN's using neural network verifiers such as Marabou
- Encodes the high dimensional RGB input images to lower dimension latent space representation using a Variational AutoEncoder structure
 
### *Current Features*
- The ```VAE_keras.ipynb``` file trains a vanilla VAE code written to create a 2D latent space representation of the *MNIST digits dataset* and create new images from the decoder
- The ```MNIST.ipynb``` file trains a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images from the *MNIST dataset* to their respective digits
- The ```VAE_modified.ipynb``` file adds a *Classifier* layer to the vanilla VAE from the ```VAE_keras``` neural network model, such that we can attain better seperation within the latent space representation
- The ```MNIST.pb``` file is an automatically generated ```.pb``` keras NN model file that is used by the ```VAE_modified``` file to classify the new recreated images from the VAE to their respective labels. This file is generated by the CNN from ```MNIST.ipynb```. In general, we will have this file handy as we will be working with pre-trained neural networks from the Phoenix stack when possible 
- The ```post_process.ipynb``` file can be used to load the CNN and VAE network models and post process the results as required for developing 2D and 3D clusters and convex hull of the latent spaces.



## How to connect to Palmetto Cluster and Run

1) Connect to ```Palmetto OnDemand``` supercomputer cluster using Clemson credentials and start a new Jupyter Notebook session. Follow the link for more instructions to start a Jupyter notebook (https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/connect/openod/apps/jupyter/)
2) Once a notebook is started, open the terminal in the notebook and git clone this repository into any folder
3) The easiest file to begin with would be the ```MNIST.ipynb``` notebook as it trains a CNN to classify the MNIST dataset.
