# Neural Verification of Deep Convolution Neural Networks

## Features
- Allows formal verification of Deep CNN's using neural network verifiers such as Marabou
- Encodes the high dimensional RGB input images to lower dimension latent space representation using a Variational AutoEncoder structure
 
### *Current Features*
- The ```VAE_keras.ipynb``` file trains a vanilla VAE code written to create a 2D latent space representation of the *MNIST digits dataset* and create new images from the decoder
- The ```MNIST.ipynb``` file trains a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images from the *MNIST dataset* to their respective digits
- The ```VAE_modified.ipynb``` file adds a *Classifier* layer to the vanilla VAE from the ```VAE_keras``` neural network model, such that we can attain better seperation within the latent space representation
- The ```MNIST.pb``` file is an automatically generated ```.pb``` keras NN model file that is used by the ```VAE_modified``` file to classify the new recreated images from the VAE to their respective labels. This file is generated by the CNN from ```MNIST.ipynb```. In general, we will have this file handy as we will be working with pre-trained neural networks from the Phoenix stack when possible 


## How to connect to Palmetto Cluster and Run

1) Connect to ```Palmetto OnDemand``` supercomputer cluster using Clemson credentials and start a new Jupyter Notebook session. Follow the link for more instructions to start a Jupyter notebook (https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/connect/openod/apps/jupyter/)


2) Once a notebook is started, open the terminal in the notebook and git clone this repository into any folder


3) The ```main.ipynb``` file trains the VAE on the MNIST dataset and then combines the CNN from ```MNIST.ipynb``` to predict class labels. Tensorflow and other necessary packages will be automatically installed when you run the first cell in the notebook. There is pre-trained CNN model already present for ease of use. The VAE model will be trained from the ```main.ipynb``` beacuse the architecture for the same is still under development
